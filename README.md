# Encryption-Decryption-Software
Encryption is the process of translating plain text data (plaintext) into something that appears to be random and meaningless (ciphertext). Encryption provide us high security and privacy on our chat/ messages ,or in sharing any confidential data on any social media . Lets take an example : if I  want to send your bank no.  password or any other legal pin or code, we can't trust on any messenger. But what happened if we encrypt this messages. Then no one can read this , even can't understand.  Now turn of Decryption  Decryption is a process of converting encrypted text back to normal text. So the people have this software and password, can ready it easily . Feel safe and secure with any messages ,keep privacy.  Now, turn to discuss how can we use this tool, means uses - 

1. Its is specially designed for our Nibba-Nibbi type of person, they can use this tool for chatting . This tool keep there privacy .  
2. 2. You can message to your crush (girlfriend /boyfriend ) at any time ,without fear of reading this message by anyone else.   
3. With the help of this tool you can share confidential data like passwords email, pin, ATM number with full privacy .    
4. Or there are many method in which we can use this tool.  5. So  please don't forget to comment me how you are going to use this tool.   The encryption and decryption come under cryptography:- What is cryptography? Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.  In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, web browsing on the internet and confidential communications such as credit card transactions and email.  Cryptography techniques Cryptography is closely related to the disciplines of cryptology and cryptanalysis. It includes techniques such as microdots, merging words with images and other ways to hide information in storage or transit. However, in today's computer-centric world, cryptography is most often associated with scrambling plaintext (ordinary text, sometimes referred to as cleartext) into ciphertext (a process called encryption), then back again (known as decryption).

6. Individuals who practice this field are known as cryptographers.  History of cryptography The word "cryptography" is derived from the Greek kryptos, meaning hidden.  The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault," and the suffix "-graphy" stands for "writing."
